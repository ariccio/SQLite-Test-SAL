NOTE TO SELF, FROM "Maintaining Private Branches Of SQLite":

FIRST, pushd INTO `raw_source`.

BEFORE MERGING CHANGES FROM SQLITE UPSTREAM,
  `fossil commit` ALL LOCAL CHANGES TO THE
  FOSSIL `private` BRANCH (`fossil update private` TO CHECKOUT PRIVATE BRANCH!)

TO BEGIN MERGING CHANGES FROM SQLITE UPSTREAM, `fossil update trunk`.
THEN, COPY NEW SQLite SOURCES INTO `raw_source`.
NEXT, CHECKOUT PRIVATE BRANCH (`fossil update private`), and MERGE WITH `fossil merge trunk`.

FINALLY, `fossil commit` TO STORE EVERYTHING IN FOSSIL.
